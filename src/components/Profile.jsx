            <strong className="text-white">I enjoy turning rough ideas into solid,</strong> working products. Sometimes that means designing APIs, sometimes wiring up real-time systems, sometimes figuring out how AI fits into the flow—and often all of it together. I’m comfortable owning features end to end, from first commit to production and beyond. What matters to me is simple  - does it work well, does it scale, and does it actually solve the problem?.
